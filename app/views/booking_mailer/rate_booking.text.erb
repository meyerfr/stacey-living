Hello <%= @user.first_name %>,

Your time at STACEY is nearly over and we hope that you had a great time, found new friends within the community and we wish you all the best wherever you go!

As we are trying to improve our experience and spread the word about Co-Living across Hamburg, we would be very grateful if you could take 5 minutes for a kind review on Google - https://g.page/stacey-living/review?rc

Move-out Instructions
To simplify the move-out process please help us by following these steps:
- Leave your Private Suite the latest at 12:00pm (noon) on the end-date
- Leave the Kiwi chip (keys) on your bedside table
- Leave all sheets and the laundry basket on the bed
- If any damages occurred during your stay, please contact us before your move-out so that we can have a look together
- We will reimburse you with the security deposit within about 2 weeks after the end-date

If you have any questions concerning the move-out or anything else to tell, you can always get back to me :)

Cheers
Buu
